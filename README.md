# CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION PROJECT

The project involves machine learning to frame a number of algorithms to detect credit card frauds. Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. 

This project proposes four different machine learning approaches to solve the given problem. It detects fraudulent transactions from a sample date that was downloaded from Kaggle. The original dataset for predicting credit card fraud might consist of highly sensitive information (like raw client transactions made using their credit card). Hence, the publicly available dataset on Kaggle has been masked.
